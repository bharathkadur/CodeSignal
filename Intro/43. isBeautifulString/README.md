<h1>isBeautifulString
</h1>
<p>A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc. Note that letter a has no previous letter.

Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.</p>

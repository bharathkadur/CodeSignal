<h1>Ada Number
</h1>
<p>Consider two following representations of a non-negative integer:

A simple decimal integer, constructed of a non-empty sequence of digits from 0 to 9;
An integer with at least one digit in a base from 2 to 16 (inclusive), enclosed between # characters, and preceded by the base, which can only be a number between 2 and 16 in the first representation. For digits from 10 to 15 characters a, b, ..., f and A, B, ..., F are used.
Additionally, both representations may contain underscore (_) characters; they are used only as separators for improving legibility of numbers and can be ignored while processing a number.

Your task is to determine whether the given string is a valid integer representation.

Note: this is how integer numbers are represented in the programming language Ada.
